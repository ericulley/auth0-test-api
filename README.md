Creating an API that will hit the Auth0 Management API to retrieve all clients & rules from the users tenant and then output an array that groups all rules associated with a specific client.

To Test:

1.) Create an Auth0 Backend/API. https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend/nodejs

2.) Fork this repository and clone a local copy.

3.) Run 'npm install' in it's root directory. 

4.) Create a .env file and inside assign the following values. These values can be found under the settings tab of the machine-to-machine app that shares the name of your newly created api. PORT can be assigned any open port, or it will default to 8080:
    - PORT=
    - DOMAIN=
    - CLIENT_ID=
    - CLIENT_SECRET=

5.) Ensure that you have set the appropriate permissions of you API machine-to-machine application to access at least the read:clients & read:rules scopes. 

6.) Start this server by running 'npm start' in it's root directory.

7.) Once the server is running, you can hit this endpoint ('http://localhost:{PORT}/mgmt/rules-per-app' ) with an exisiting application that sends an approprite jwt to the endpoint, or you can create a simple app to access this api.
